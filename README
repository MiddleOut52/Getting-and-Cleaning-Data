The r_analysis.R script does the following things:

1) Imports the dataset from the downloaded zip file
2) Reads in the activities, and the subjet IDs
3) Reads in the test and train tables, and binds the columns for each
4) Binds the rows of the test table with the rows of the train table
5) Removes the columns that do not pertain to mean and std
6) Renames the columns to be more informative
7) Creates a new dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
