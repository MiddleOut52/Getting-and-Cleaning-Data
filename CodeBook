Changes to the data:

After importing the data, all of the values that did not pertain to mean or std were removed.
Another data manipulation done, was renaming the variables to add clarity


Variables:

1) activity, features, subject_train, x_train, y_train, subject_test, x_test and y_test are all used to store the data
2) training_data and test_data are the result of binding columns of the above variables
3) combined_data is the result of binding the rows of training_data and test_data
4) mean_std creates a logical vector that is TRUE is the column contains mean or std
5) tidy_data2 is a data set with the average of each variable for each activity for each subject
